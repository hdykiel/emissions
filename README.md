# emissions

The `emissions` package helps calculate greenhouse gas emissions from travel activities based on guidance provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For their [Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf#page=12){target=_blank_}, the IPCC calculated typical ranges of CO2 emissions of various transport modes per kilometer per passenger. Emissions from passenger aircraft ranged from 100 to 250 grams per kilometer traveled. This range can be used to estimate carbon emissions from air travel.
